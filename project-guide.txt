**📚 Book Recommendation Engine - Project Guide**

**✅ Requirements:**  
Build a K-Nearest Neighbors model that recommends 5 similar books for any input title using the Book-Crossings dataset (1.1M ratings).

**🛠️ What I Built:**  
- Preprocessed 270K books & 90K users with pandas  
- Filtered for statistical significance (>100 ratings/book, >200 ratings/user)  
- Created user-book rating matrix with sparse optimization  
- Implemented KNN with cosine similarity metric  
- Built function that returns: `[input_book, [[recommended_book, distance], ...]]`  

**🎯 Key Challenge:**  
Handling sparse data efficiently while maintaining recommendation quality.

**📊 Validation:**  
System successfully recommends books like "Catch-22" for vampire novels with measured distances.

**🚀 Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
